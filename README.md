# check_ssl
This Nagios plugin monitors the SSL/TLS settings, using the SSLLABS (https://www.ssllabs.com/) Web service, performs tests on certificates, seeking vulnerabilities, and in case of detection returns the warning or critical state, depending on the arguments defined, namely the domain name and the values for warning and critical, which are based on the classification table of the SSLLAB, and the quantity of days before the expiry of the certificate from which it is desirable to be notified. By omission, the absence of 30 days less for the certificate expires, is notified with the warning state, regardless of the outcome of the Web tests service. Classifications C+, C-, C, D+, D, D- are by default considered critical, whereas ratings and E+, E, E-, F+, F, F-, T, M are interpreted as warning.
